# üöÄ InnArt Deployment Verification

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the deployment options and verification steps for the InnArt NFT Marketplace.

## üìã Deployment Options

InnArt can be deployed using multiple methods:

### 1. GitHub Pages (Automatic Deployment)

The project is configured with GitHub Actions for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages:

- **Repository URL**: [https://github.com/llakterian/innoart_](https://github.com/llakterian/innoart_)
- **Deployed Site**: [https://llakterian.github.io/innoart_/](https://llakterian.github.io/innoart_/)
- **Deployment Trigger**: Push to `main` branch or manual workflow dispatch
- **Configuration**: `.github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml`

### 2. Netlify Deployment

For Netlify deployment, use the optimized deployment package:

- **Command**: `npm run deploy:netlify`
- **Output**: `deploy/innoart-netlify.zip`
- **Upload URL**: [https://netlify.com/drop](https://netlify.com/drop)
- **Configuration**: `netlify.toml`

## üîç Known Issues & Workarounds

### GitHub Pages Routing

GitHub Pages doesn't natively support client-side routing. We've implemented a workaround:

1. A custom 404.html page that redirects to the main application
2. A script in index.html that handles the redirect parameters
3. This ensures that direct links to internal pages work correctly

### Environment Variables

For security reasons, environment variables are not included in the deployment. If you need to use environment variables:

1. For Netlify: Configure them in the Netlify dashboard
2. For GitHub Pages: Use a configuration file that's loaded at runtime

## üì± Mobile Testing

For comprehensive mobile testing:

1. Use browser developer tools to simulate different devices
2. Test on actual mobile devices when possible
3. Verify touch interactions work correctly
4. Check that wallet connection works on mobile browsers

## üîê Security Considerations

1. No private keys or sensitive information should be included in the deployment
2. All blockchain interactions happen client-side through the user's wallet
3. The application uses HTTPS for all communications
4. User data is stored locally and not transmitted to any servers

## üìà Performance Optimization

The deployment has been optimized for performance:

1. Assets are minified and compressed
2. Images are optimized for web
3. Code splitting is implemented for faster loading
4. Caching headers are set for static assets

## üåê Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

To use a custom domain:

1. Purchase a domain from a registrar
2. Configure DNS settings to point to your deployment
3. Update the base path in the application configuration
4. Update links to use the new domain

## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the deployment:

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify that all environment variables are set correctly
3. Clear browser cache and cookies
4. Try a different browser or device

For persistent issues, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
