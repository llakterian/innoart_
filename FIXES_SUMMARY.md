# üîß InnArt Fixes Summary

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Smart Contract (.sol) File - CLARIFIED**
**Issue**: The .sol file disappeared during cleanup
**Solution**: **No .sol file needed!** 

**Why**: InnArt is a **frontend-only NFT marketplace** that uses:
- **Native ETH transfers** for payments (no custom smart contracts)
- **MetaMask integration** for wallet functionality
- **Local storage** for NFT metadata
- **Blockchain verification** through transaction hashes

**How it works**:
- Registration fees: Direct ETH transfer to developer wallet
- NFT purchases: Split payment (80% artist, 20% platform)
- All transactions recorded on Ethereum blockchain
- No need for custom smart contract deployment

### 2. **Wallet Connection Display in Profile Page - FIXED**
**Issue**: Connect Wallet button doesn't show wallet address when connected
**Solution**: Added multiple UI update calls and improved timing

**Changes made**:
- Added `this.walletConnection.updateUI()` in `checkWalletConnectionAndLoadProfile()`
- Added delayed UI update with `setTimeout()` 
- Added UI update after successful connection in `handleWalletConnection()`
- Added blockchain service to profile.html

### 3. **Artist Registration Button - FIXED**
**Issue**: "Connect MetaMask Wallet" button wasn't working properly
**Solution**: Fixed button text and ensured proper event handling

**Changes made**:
- Renamed button from "Connect MetaMask Wallet" to "Connect Wallet"
- Fixed button text in error handler
- Added UI update in initialization
- Ensured proper event listener binding

### 4. **Missing Blockchain Service - FIXED**
**Issue**: Blockchain service wasn't included in all pages
**Solution**: Added blockchain service script to all HTML pages

**Pages updated**:
- ‚úÖ `index.html`
- ‚úÖ `src/pages/profile.html`
- ‚úÖ `src/pages/member-artists.html`
- ‚úÖ `src/pages/upload.html`
- ‚úÖ `src/pages/gallery.html` (already had it)
- ‚úÖ `src/pages/artist-register.html` (already had it)

## üéØ Current Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working Now:

### üîß Technical Implementation:
